# What happened?
Email dev service returned 400 Bad Request for attachments over 10MB.

# What went wrong and why?
Reverse proxy body size limit defaulted to 10MB in a base image update. The app expected 25MB in dev parity with prod.

# How did we respond?
* 07:52 UTC – CI integration tests failed; dev on-call engaged.
* 08:01 UTC – Increased proxy body size limit to 25MB and rebuilt image.
* 08:07 UTC – Tests green; incident closed.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Lock proxy config via template and validation (Completed)
* Add regression test for attachment size (In progress)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Compress large attachments and prefer links for very large content.
