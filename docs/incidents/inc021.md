# What happened?
Short spike in 500s from services relying on Redis for session storage.

# What went wrong and why?
Background save (RDB) overlapped with peak traffic on a VM with constrained IO, causing momentary stalls.

# How did we respond?
* 13:04 UTC – Error alert fired; disabled RDB for the window and shifted to AOF.
* 13:11 UTC – IO utilization stabilized.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Schedule snapshots during off-peak (Completed)
* Move to Redis managed service with better IO isolation (Planned)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Retry non-idempotent operations with safeguards and backoff.
