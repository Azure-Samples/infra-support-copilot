# What happened?
UAT users reported broken static assets and console errors in the web frontend after a deploy.

# What went wrong and why?
The asset hash didn’t change but content did, due to a missed cache-busting step in the pipeline. CDN served mixed versions of JS bundles.

# How did we respond?
* 15:47 UTC – QA raised issue; reverted to previous build.
* 15:56 UTC – Fixed pipeline to always append content hash and triggered purge.
* 16:07 UTC – Assets consistent; incident closed.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Enforce build reproducibility and hash verification (Completed)
* Add smoke test to load multiple pages and validate bundle versions (In progress)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Hard refresh or clear cache if UI appears inconsistent after deploy.
