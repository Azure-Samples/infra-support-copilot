# What happened?
Between 08:22 and 08:47 UTC, authentication token issuance intermittently failed (~9% 5xx) and latency spiked (p95 ~3.8s) for users routed to West Europe.

# What went wrong and why?
A mis-timed signing key rollover left an outdated JWKS cached at the API gateway layer. Requests validated against the old key failed until the stale cache expired. The configured cache TTL (30 minutes) was too long and no manual purge capability was enabled.

# How did we respond?
* 08:24 UTC – Auth SLO alert fired; on-call engaged.
* 08:29 UTC – Correlated failures with JWKS key-id mismatch in gateway logs.
* 08:33 UTC – Pushed emergency config to reduce JWKS cache TTL to 60s; initiated gateway instance recycle.
* 08:41 UTC – Error rate trending down; latency normalizing.
* 08:47 UTC – Incident resolved; continued monitoring.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add safe key rollover runbook with pre-warm and verification (Completed)
* Enable admin endpoint to purge JWKS cache on gateways (In progress – Sep 2025)
* Lower default JWKS TTL to 60s with jitter (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Implement short-lived token caching with clock skew tolerance.
* Retry idempotent auth flows with exponential backoff and jitter.
