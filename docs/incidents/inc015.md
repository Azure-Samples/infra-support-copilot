# What happened?
Intermittent VPN tunnel flaps impacted access to the DR site for ~14 minutes, causing brief replication delays.

# What went wrong and why?
An IPSec rekey timer mismatch with the peer gateway caused overlapping rekeys and transient phase 2 failures.

# How did we respond?
* 05:46 UTC – Network monitoring alerted on tunnel state changes.
* 05:51 UTC – Adjusted rekey lifetimes and aligned with peer configuration.
* 05:58 UTC – Tunnels stabilized; replication caught up.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Standardize IPSec lifetimes with configuration templates (Completed)
* Add staggered rekey offsets to avoid overlaps (In progress)
* Increase alert sensitivity for phase 2 negotiation failures (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Ensure redundant connectivity for DR access.
* Monitor replication lag and alert on thresholds.
