# What happened?
Between 12:05 and 12:47 UTC a subset of legacy customer support workflows experienced delayed chatbot handoffs to human agents (median delay 8m vs normal <30s). This occurred during decommissioning activities for the legacy Support Chatbot server.

# What went wrong and why?
The legacy chatbot (status: Decommissioned) still handled a small fraction (~4%) of intents not yet migrated. During data export we disabled an internal Redis cache warm-up script. This increased cold start latency for NLP model loads. Simultaneously, a misconfigured DNS TTL (set to 1 hour instead of 60 seconds) prevented rapid cutover of remaining intents to the new platform. Queue depth for escalation messages increased, and the absence of a proper drain mode allowed new sessions to continue landing on the legacy node.

# How did we respond?
* 12:05 UTC – Handoff latency alert fired (p95 > 5m); incident opened (SEV3).
* 12:12 UTC – Identified active decommission task; paused data export.
* 12:18 UTC – Manually initiated cache warm-up; latency improved but still elevated.
* 12:25 UTC – Lowered DNS TTL and forced cache purge on recursive resolvers where possible.
* 12:34 UTC – Updated routing rules to divert remaining intents to new platform.
* 12:47 UTC – Handoff latency normalized (<30s); incident closed.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Implement formal drain mode preventing new sessions before decommission steps (In progress – Aug 2025)
* Add checklist item to verify DNS TTL before cutover (Completed)
* Automate cache warm-up for remaining legacy components (Planned – Aug 2025)
* Create migration progress dashboard with residual legacy traffic indicator (Planned – Sept 2025)
* Add intent-level routing verification test pre and post cutover (Planned – Sept 2025)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Migrate custom integrations pointing to legacy endpoints to the new platform promptly when notified.
* Monitor handoff latency and configure alerts aligned with operational SLAs.
* Use provided bulk intent mapping tools to validate that no deprecated intents remain in use ahead of decommission dates.
