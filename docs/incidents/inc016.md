# What happened?
Spike in 401 responses for auth token refresh calls (~7%) between 12:21 and 12:35 UTC.

# What went wrong and why?
Clock skew on two nodes exceeded allowed drift after NTP source failover; token validation using exp/nbf windows rejected near-boundary tokens.

# How did we respond?
* 12:23 UTC – Auth error-rate alert fired.
* 12:27 UTC – Re-synced NTP and drained skewed nodes.
* 12:35 UTC – Error rate returned to baseline.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add monotonic clock checks and enforce tighter NTP monitoring (In progress)
* Increase tolerance window by 30s with strict auditing (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Implement retries for borderline expiry tokens and refresh slightly ahead of expiry.
