# What happened?
DR site connectivity degraded for select partners using IKEv1, causing intermittent tunnel renegotiation failures.

# What went wrong and why?
An upstream provider changed cipher suite preferences; our gateway prioritized weaker suites first, leading to negotiation retries and timeouts.

# How did we respond?
* 19:25 UTC – Monitoring flagged increased renegotiations; network on-call engaged.
* 19:34 UTC – Reordered cipher suites to prefer modern strong ciphers; disabled weak ones.
* 19:41 UTC – Negotiations stabilized.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Adopt IKEv2-only for new partners and sunset IKEv1 (In progress)
* Continuous config compliance checks for crypto settings (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Prefer IKEv2 and modern cipher suites.
* Maintain redundant tunnels and monitor S2S health.
