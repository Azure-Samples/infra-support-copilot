# What happened?
Checkout sandbox experienced increased 429 rate-limit responses during a partner integration test.

# What went wrong and why?
Global rate limits were applied instead of per-tenant limits due to a misconfiguration in the API gateway policy. A single tenant’s burst traffic impacted others.

# How did we respond?
* 09:06 UTC – QA reported widespread 429s; on-call validated.
* 09:12 UTC – Corrected rate limit policy to per-tenant and raised tenant quota for partner test window.
* 09:18 UTC – Error rates normalized.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add policy linter to enforce keying on tenant identifier (In progress)
* Provide per-tenant dashboards for rate-limit usage (Planned)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Coordinate high-burst tests and request temporary quota increases.
* Implement client-side backoff on 429s.
