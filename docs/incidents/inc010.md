# What happened?
Legacy support chatbot endpoint returned 410 Gone for all requests after a decommission change propagated prematurely to a still-referenced DNS name.

# What went wrong and why?
An internal wiki still referenced the legacy endpoint; a DNS CNAME cleanup occurred before clients had fully migrated. Health checks were disabled after decommission, masking the issue.

# How did we respond?
* 01:10 UTC – Support tickets spiked; triage initiated.
* 01:18 UTC – Restored CNAME temporarily with TTL 300s and added redirect notice.
* 01:29 UTC – Updated wiki and customer runbooks; notified impacted users.
* 01:41 UTC – Traffic shifted to new chatbot; retired legacy endpoint again.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add link checker to find legacy endpoints in internal docs (In progress)
* Require DNS decommission change to be gated by zero‑ref validation (Planned)
* Keep health checks enabled until traffic is zero for 7 days (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Update bookmarks and scripts to the new chatbot endpoint.
* Monitor deprecation notices and subscribe to change emails.
