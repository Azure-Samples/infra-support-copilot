# What happened?
Staging reports intermittently failed with 503 during nightly ETL.

# What went wrong and why?
Connection pool exhaustion occurred when ETL and reporting shared the same DB user; pool settings didn’t enforce fair usage, starving reporting during spikes.

# How did we respond?
* 00:16 UTC – Alert fired for 503 spike; on-call engaged.
* 00:22 UTC – Split DB users and quotas; increased reporting pool size and added timeouts.
* 00:31 UTC – 503s ceased; incident closed.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Separate ETL and reporting pools with resource governance (Completed)
* Stagger ETL steps to reduce peak concurrency (In progress)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Schedule heavy report runs outside the ETL window.
