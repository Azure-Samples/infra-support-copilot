# What happened?
Developers observed delayed email dispatch and sporadic 500s from the email service dev environment between 03:55 and 04:22 UTC.

# What went wrong and why?
An experimental feature flag enabled synchronous DKIM key fetch on first use. The key store backed by a slow disk mounted volume led to cold start delays and N+1 fetches for batch sends.

# How did we respond?
* 03:57 UTC – CI smoke test failed; dev on-call paged.
* 04:05 UTC – Rolled back the feature flag to async prefetch.
* 04:12 UTC – Warmed DKIM cache with synthetic send.
* 04:22 UTC – Metrics normalized; incident closed.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add pre-warm job for DKIM keys on deploy (Completed)
* Add rate limit and dedupe for key fetches (In progress)
* Replace slow disk with premium SSD on the mount (Planned)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Retry transient email send failures; use bulk API for batch operations.
* Use webhooks to track delivery instead of polling during slowdowns.
