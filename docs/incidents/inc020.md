# What happened?
Residual traffic hit the legacy chatbot due to a stale CDN rule, resulting in 404s for some assets.

# What went wrong and why?
A deprecated CDN endpoint wasn’t fully purged from all POPs; cache-control headers were missing on the deprecation page leading to prolonged caching.

# How did we respond?
* 04:25 UTC – Support reported inconsistencies; triaged to CDN.
* 04:33 UTC – Forced global purge and added no-store headers.
* 04:41 UTC – Traffic fully redirected to the new service.

# How are we making incidents like this less likely or less impactful?
* Add automated CDN purge as part of decommission pipeline (In progress)
* Add canary POP check after rule changes (Completed)

# How can customers make incidents like this less impactful?
* Clear browser cache or force refresh if encountering 404s after migration.
